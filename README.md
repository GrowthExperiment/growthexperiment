# The Growth Experiment
Crypto currencies allow to build an economy where tokens are distributed fairly to a large number of participants.
The Growth Experiment will make it easy to distribute a crypto currency on the Ethereum block chain as ERC-20 token,
including basic income features for accounts with verified identity.

The web DAPP will allow anyone to launch their token and retain an owner's stake to pay for distribution.
Owners can delegate Identity Services to verify users' identity, depending on the group the coin will be distributed to.
Identity Services may require a payment for their verification.

The Growth Experiment Coin will have:
- an `allowance` defined by number of coins per second accruing to every verified account
- a `starting balance` added once to every verified account

The Growth Experiment Coin will feature basic on-chain governance tools:
- election of `officials`
- definition of an `inflation rate` (by the `elected officials`) accruing over time to a `community fund`
- `elected officials` may spend coins in the `community fund`
